												<p>Our final year project is Health API and Mobile Application. Mainly here we forcused on four areas which were as follows in detail; <br/>
													1)<b>Help patients follow up with their medications through reminders and mapping of patient and medical information</b>. This would be through mapping of patients and 
														their medical information, (given that the medicine the patients are given is stored in the system) we can use that information to help patients follow up 
														with their medications. For example, if you are supposed to take your medication 3X a day i.e morning, evening and night......the mobile application would 
														be able to send you automatic reminders for all the prescribed drugs. <br/> 
													2) <b>Predict patient needs based on past medical trends</b> - #####################################################################################################<br/>
												
													3) <b>Chat bots/ Health Assistant</b>. We aimed at providing AI driven medical recommendations based on patient history and communication of symptoms, health tips and 
														medical management)<br/>
													Why chatbots and health assistants?<br/>
													We looked at a vision where one can ably consult an AI doctor for recommendation on how to go about certain illnesses. This AI doctor could provide a series 
														of steps on how to go about a particular medical situation.<br/>
												
													4) <b>Telemedicine.</b> For this, we have something that differs from the conventional approach to telemedicine. How? With data provision from our API and recommendations
														from our AI assistant / chatbot.........a combination of these will be able not only to provide health tips and courses of action regarding various medical 
														challenges but also recommend the rightful medical drugs to administer. It will come with pharmacy or health center mapping, in that our AI can recommend a 
														drug and also go ahead to contact the nearest health facility through our API to enable delivery of that drug. Then in cases where it is not cost effective 
														for the patient, the AI could recommend a drug shop close by and the distance to the drug shop to enable quick response treatment. This could be applied for 
														ambulances too for emergency cases.</p>
